# java-autoitx-gradle-boilerplate

> Run your favorite AutoIt applications inside the **Java spring-boot** context.  

If anyone still struggling to use AutoIt in java, you can use this, as a boilerplate to start.
It's using **Gradle** and **Springframework**.

You won't need to install AutoIt, because it installs the missing dll with Regsvr automatically if it's missing.
With Gradle, all the dependency is downloaded and configured to start playing with AutoIt in Java
I'm not professional, but maybe I can help with it.

# Installation:
> Easy install with **Gradle**

In **IntelliJ**, import as a **Gradle**project. Turn on **Annotation Processing** in your IntelliJ Settings.  
Run as a spring-boot project.
